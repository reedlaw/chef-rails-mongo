Cooking from scratch
====================

We're going to start out by building our ideal system and then extract
the recipes from there.

Target system
-------------

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ruby 1.9.2-p290
* Rails 3.1
* Mongodb 2.0.0

To install the latest ruby, it will help to have a `.deb` package
available. I followed the instructions
[here](http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/ruby-1-9-2-on-ubuntu-11-04/). I
also packaged `nginx 1.0.6` according to [these instructions](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1105902).
